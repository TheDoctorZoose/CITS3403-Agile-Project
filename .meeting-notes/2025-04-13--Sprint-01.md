## 💻 GitHub Workflow Conventions

### 📌 Issues

Used to track bugs, tasks, and feature requests.  
Always create an Issue before starting new work.

> ⚠️ **Warning**  
> Include enough detail in Issue descriptions that *any team member* could pick up the task if necessary.

#### Examples

##### Feature Request

**Title:** `Prevent students from signing up to multiple projects #1`  
**Description:**  
**Feature:** Prevent individual students from being added to multiple groups.  
**Proposed Implementation:** When the request to create a new group is submitted to the server, it should check whether any members of the proposed group have already been assigned to a group, and if so report an error instead of adding the group to the database.

##### Bug Report

**Title:** `Cannot sign up if you are called Taylor Swift #1`  
**Description:**  
**Problem:** Anyone should be able to sign up regardless of their name. However, if a student is called `Taylor Swift`, the submit button no longer works.  
**To Reproduce:**
1. Go to sign-up page  
2. Enter a group size of 1  
3. Enter any student ID and the name "Taylor Swift"  
4. Click submit  
**Possible Cause:** We reserve the value `5461796c6f72205377696674` in our database to indicate "no student." By coincidence, this is the hex value of the string `"Taylor Swift"`.

> ℹ️ **Labels**  
> Suggested GitHub Issue Labels:
> - `ui` – visual/layout tasks (HTML/CSS only)  
> - `view:intro`, `view:upload`, `view:visualise`, `view:share` – tag by relevant view  
> - `discussion-needed` – for topics needing team-wide input

### 🖋️ Commit Messages

- One-line summary, imperative mood  
- Semantic prefixes:
  - `feat`: new feature  
  - `fix`: bug fix  
  - `docs`: documentation  
  - `refactor`: code improvement
