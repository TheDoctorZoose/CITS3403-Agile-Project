## 4. Project Status

---

## 5. Discussion and Decisions

### Data Sharing Mechanism

- Users log a game session and tag other players.
- Tagged users can **accept** the entry into their own database.
- Prevents duplication of data.
- Sessions shared by others will be flagged.

**Decision:**  
Good idea — will implement if time allows (medium-high priority).

---

### Upload Data View Changes

Player fields must:
- Include optional **Username**.
- Checkbox for "**Share data**" with the player.
- Boolean fields:
  - **Win?**
  - **Went first?**
  - **First time played?**

---

### Analysis Features

- Focus on **filtering by Game**.
- Show streaks, high scores, average scores, wins/losses.
- **Nemesis system**: Find players you often lose to.

---

### Share View Adjustments

- Boost "Shared with You" posts to the top of the feed.
- Allow sharing individual stats/visualisations.

---

### Other Small Notes

- Stretch Goal: Auto-fill game data via BoardGameGeek API.
- Simplify intro page to welcome text + CTA buttons ("Create Account", "Log In").

---

## 6. Presentation Draft (Slim Outline)

- **Introduction:** Who we are, what the app does.
- **User Needs:** Log games, view stats, share data.
- **Target Audience:** Board gamers interested in statistics.
- **User Journey:** Intro → Upload → Analyse → Share.
- **Demo:** Show static HTML pages; explain the key flows.

> **Note:**  
> The Presentation Draft was mainly a structure to guide our discussion — not the final deck.
